    "IMPROVE IN-VITRO FERTILIZATION SUCCESS RATIO\n",
    "\n",
    "Infertility rates are on the rise worldwide due to multiple factors related to changes in our modern lifestyles. Couples are deciding to conceive children later in life more so than in the past. A male partner is more likely to experience infertility over the age of 40. Also, a woman’s eggs quality and quantity decline as she gets older. Other factors behind the rise in infertility include environmental factors, medications, smoking, and stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) offers a viable solution to many couples facing infertility problems. However, the success rate of In-Vitro Fertilization is an average of only 30%. The cost of an IVF cycle in the United States ranges between $15,000 and $30,000. With the low success rate, many couples are going through the process several times, incurring high costs. Other couples give up altogether after the first cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "IVF procedures are expensive, and most of the time not covered by insurance. At the same time, the IVF industry is expected to grow at an annual rate of 10% for the next 8 years, making the issue of success rate volumetrically even more significant in the mid-term. IVF procedures carry a heavy emotional and economical burden on patients, and with all the factors considered, it means that many patients never achieve pregnancy. The issue might not be solved entirely, at least perhaps not in the short term, but taking steps towards incrementally improving the chances of success would lead to more and more satisfied patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to identify and categorize the root causes of IVF failure and then find a solution to a major contributing cause of failure using a data-driven approach."
