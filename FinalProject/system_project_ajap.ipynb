    "Infertility is a growing problem worldwide. Infertility is defined as the inability to achieve pregnancy by either the male or the female reproductive systems of patients. In 2022, in the United States, an estimated 11% of women and 9% of men suffer from infertility. There are multiple reasons behind the growing trend of infertility, with our evolving lifestyles amongst the main contributing factors. A predominant consequence of modern life in couples seeking to start a family is the fact they are reaching this decision later in life, more so than previous generations. A male partner is more likely to experience infertility over the age 0f 40. Also, a woman's ovum's quality declines as she gets older, reducing the likelihood of a succesful pregnancy. Female ova also decline in quantity over the years. Other factors behind the rise in infertility include environmental factors, medications, smoking, and stress.\n",

    "In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) offers a viable solution to many couples facing infertility problems. IVF is the most widely used form of Assisted Reproductive Technology. Although the name might suggest this is a single procedure, in reality, IVF is a very complex process involving many steps that take several weeks or months to complete. At a high level, the IVF process starts with the female patient taking fertility medications for several months to induce ovum production. During this time, the female patient takes several blood tests and ultrasounds to monitor hormone levels and track ovum production. At a certain point, it is determined that the female patient has started to produce sufficient mature eggs. Following this, an IVF specialist retrieves eggs from the patient's body, which is a minor surgical procedure. Afterwards, the eggs retrieved are fertilized or inseminated with sperm cells from the male partner or donor. The inseminated eggs are stored in a special incubator for 3 to 5 days. During this time, the fertilized embryos go through several growth stages or milestones. After the incubation period, the doctor selects the best embryos based on experience and proceeds to transfer them to the female patient. Some patients may continue hormone treatment for several weeks after the embryo transfer. A succesful pregnancy occurs when at least one embryo attaches to the uterus and begins to develop properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/img_02.jpg\"  \n",
    "     width=\"550\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The success rate of In-Vitro Fertilization is an average of only 30%. As we have seen, IVF is a long and complicated process, and because of this, it has multiple points of failure. There are also several other factors, such as the age of the female patient, and lifestyle choices. Some important factors that may lead to the success or failure of an IVF procedure also include embryo quality, response of the ovarium, implantation issues, DNA and chromosomal abnormalities. Let us also consider that the average cost of an IVF cycle in the United States ranges somewhere between USD 15,000 and USD 30,000. With the low success rate, the majority of couples require going through the process several times to achieve a pregnancy, incurring in very high costs. Many other couples give up altogether without ever achieving a pregnancy. Another important cost factor is that the procedure is rarely covered by medical insurance, meaning patients need to pay full costs out of pocket. All of the context combined, with the costs and the low chances of succes, carry a large emotional toll for the couple seeking to get pregnant. Starting a family is a milestone in the life of many people, and having to go through an ART procedure for what otherwise occurs naturally, is extremely difficult, based on my personal experience supporting an IVF clinic.\n",
    "\n",
    "It appears that, until recently two or three years ago, there had not been comprehensive research to understand the root cause or causes of IVF failure. Although some factors have long been established, such as the age of the mother and its correlation to embryo quality, those seemed to have a relatively minor impact on success. The ratio of success ranges from 25% to 40%, depending on the age of the mother. Then, 40% success still leaves a lot of room for improvement. Other factors, such as the environment, lifestyle of both parents, and even stress, have also been considered, but still did not move the needle much in terms of increasing chances of success. Recent studies are pointing to DNA replication issues as one of the main culprits. More importantly, if this is proven to be a major root cause, there are some attempts at improving this using vision systems and big data analysis to select the best embryos for a procedure. This could be an game changer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is the recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence have provided a wealth of tools that promise to revolutionize many industries, and IVF could be one of them. Innovative AI-driven tools offer the potential to bring substantial improvements and breakthorughs in IVF procedures. At the same time, the IVF industry is expected to grow at an annual rate of 10% for the next 8 years, making the issue of success rate volumetrically even more significant in the mid-term. As we mentioned before, IVF procedures carry a heavy emotional and economical burden on patients, and with all the factors considered, it means that many patients never achieve pregnancy. The issue might not be solved entirely, at least perhaps not in the short term, but taking steps towards incrementally improving the chances of success would lead to more and more satisfied patients."

    "## SECTION 2: SCOPE\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several avenues through which Artificial Intelligence can enhance different aspects of In-Vitro Fertilization. Integrating AI-enabled tools into reproductive medicine has substantial potential to improve the outcomes in many ways. Throughout this course, as we advanced through the different topics of the class, I did research on how a specific tool or method could be implemented into IVF. However, I consistently faced an important challenge overall, which is the unavailability of public data or datasets that cover the IVF process comprehensively. At some point, I thought of changing to a completely different topic for the system project, but then I decided to stay with IVF and learn how much can be done today and how much else is missing. This subject holds immense personal significance for me, and I'm deeply committed to further exploring and expanding upon it as I progress through my Master's program.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have established before, IVF comprises intricate processes involving multiple sequential steps. Viewing IVF as a set of interconnected subsystems, each one contributing to the common objective of achieving a successful pregnancy, we can see numerous areas where Artificial Intelligence can be applied. Some of these areas are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predictive Analytics: AI algorithms can be utilzied for analyzing patient data, including medical histories, genetic information, and treatment outcomes. AI can then forecast the likelihood of success, enabling fertility clinics to personalize treatment/\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enhanced Embryo Selection: Ai-assisted time-lapse image analysis allows for the continuous monitoring of embryo development without disturbing the incubation process. Machine Learning helps analyze time-lapse images to identify development milestones, potentially increasing success. I will expand on this topic towards the end of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Patient Care and Support: new tools such as chatbots and virtual assistants can provide 24/7 support, answering patient questions and providing educational resources. This would enhance the overall patient experience and help reduce anxiety throughout the process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimized Treatment: with AI, treatments could be optimized based on patient responeses. Customization could be nearly real time, ensuring that the treatment is adjusted dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Research and Innovation: AI will continue to accelerate the discovery of new treatment modalities and innovative techniques to advance the field of reproductive medicine further.\n",

    "In this project assigment, we will focus on predictive analytics. There are two main reasons for this. One, I believe that this is the natural starting point for someone like me who comes from a different background. I have dedicated my career to Automated Vehicles, and I hope that my industrial and manufacturing background can bring a fresh set of perspectives to these problems. However, this means I am not a subject matter expert, and thus, starting with predictive analytics will help me gain more knowledge. The other reason is the lack of publicly available data. In fact, the issue could be that thare are just not enough available data for a comprehensive study of the whole IVF process. Nonetheless, I did find datasets that will help cover the scope of predictive analytics for this project."

    "## SECTION 3: DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, finding publicly available datasets that cover the IVF process comprehensively was not possible. Furthermore, reading through some research papers on the subject, I realized that many studies focus on specific steps of the process, in particular, the embryo development stages in the incubator. These studies may or may not collect additional information about the female patient, and in most cases, they did not collect data about the male partner. My vision is to construct a dataset with all relevant features of the process, starting from general patient data to including morphokinetic evolution specifics. That dataset does not seem to exist yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the scope of this project, I did find extensive data on success rates linked to some important patient population features in the country. There are four datasets that I will use as input for this project. All of them come from the US Department of Health and Human Services, which publishes yearly reports on the state of ART in the United States. The latest release of the datasets is for the year 2021, and the publication dates are from July and August of 2023. This is the most recent information available from 454 reporting clinics accross the country. \n",

ClinicID is a unique identifier for each of the reporting clinics.

Information about the location, clinic Director, address, city, zip code, and phone number are not relevant for the purpose of this study. Information about the State each clinic is in could be meaningful for an audit-like study seeking to understand if there is a geographical relationship to the outcomes of ART procedures. For this analysis, I am considering the general population comprised of 454 ART clinics who reported their outcomes to the US Health Department, since our focus is on specifics about the IVF process, and not geographical factors.\n",

    "- After careful consideration, the Services and Profiles dataset will not be included. This dataset contains information about the types of services provided by each clinic in the report. However, since all the clinics in the study provide IVF services, this set was considered redundant, and it could add noise to the classification model. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It is well known that IVF procedures come with relatively high chances of multiple-births (twins, triplets). For instance, while multiple-birth rates occur at 2% to 3% naturally, succesfull pregnancies achieved through ART carry a nearly 30% probability of multiple births. In many instances, the datasets include breakdowns for a particular feature into single-births, multiple-births, and total combined. Our goal in this project is to evaluate features and focus on the outcome, which is whether there was a sucesful pregnancy or not, regardless of single or multiple births. Therefore, I will extracting the combined totals whenever single or multiple births breakdowns are included.\n",

    "## SECTION 5: FINDINGS\n",
    "\n",
    "**First Run**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first run of the regression models yielded the results below. No hyperparameters were tuned in the first step.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/img_06.jpg\"  \n",
    "     width=\"550\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Regression:  \n",
    "The training and test accuracies are close, which indicates that the performance on unseen data is similar to the training set. However, the relatively low accuracy rate indicates that the model could be underfitting the data. In other words, it means that Liner Regression is probably not capturing the complexities and patterns from the dataset. We anticipated the predictive power of this algorithm to be relatively low for our dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Forest Regression:  \n",
    "This is the best performing model out of the three chosen. The accuracy on the training data means that the algorithm was able to learn very well. However, the fact that we got lower accuracy on the test set implies that there is some overfitting factor. To correct this, I am going to tune some of the hyperparameters and run the test again.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting Regression:\n",
    "This algorithm also presents some overfitting factor, and it also performs relatively worse when compared against Random Forest. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the first results, I am going to continue adjusting the hyperparameters of Random Forest Regression to obtain better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hyperparameters Adjust**  \n",
    "Instead of testing different hyperparameter values manually, I used RandomSearch along with an array of parameters to be tested and fitted. I commented out this code because it takes exceedingly high running time. If you would like to see it run, please uncomment the RandomSearch lines in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with the best hyperparameter setting, the program returned similar accuracy results than before.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/img_07.jpg\"  \n",
    "     width=\"550\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Change Train/Test Split**  \n",
    "The next attemp was to change the train/test split ratio to 70% and 30% respectively. This resulted in a slight increase in test and train accuracy results, returning the hyperparameters to default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/img_08.jpg\"  \n",
    "     width=\"550\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis and experimentation conducted, the Random Forest Regression model shows a high accuracy on the training data, and slightly lower on the test data. This indicates that there is a potentially slight overfitting. However, the test accuracy is still relatively good when compared against the other algorithms, which suggests a good performance overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while there might be room for slight improvement with the Random Forest Regression, the results obtained are acceptable and can be considered for practical applications, given the nature and requirements of the dataset.\n"

    "This project was a first step towards the long-term goal of building a dataset that includes all relevant features for the IVF process. Publicly available data is sparse.

    "This goal was achieved succesfully. Datasets found in HealthData.gov include relevant features that describe rates of success (pregnancy achieved) for more than 450 clinics in the United States. Some features included are: percentage of intended egg retrievals, percentage of actual egg retrievals, type of embryo, age of the patient, among others.\n",

Section 5 describes de evaluation process that helped me determine that Random Forest Regression is the best algorithm to analyze this dataset due to the complex relationships between its variables. As the larger dataset is built, this algorithm will continue to be the first choice for analysis.\n"

    "Accesibility is crucial with technology in the medical sector. A web-based deployment will enable medical professionals and other stakeholders to access this application from any location with an internet connection (and the appropriate credentials). This flexibility ensures quick and convenient access, which is a must in the fast-paced healthcare industry. This also fosters quick decision-making for IVF service providers, regardless of their physical location.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scalability:  \n",
    "Scalability is important due to varying user loads. Being web-based, the application will be able to adapt to increasing user demands without compromising performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Security:  \n",
    "This is a highly important feature for this application, considering the sensitive nature of patient data that will be handled. With a web-based deployment, a robust set of security measures can be implemented, such as encryption protocoals and security updates. These measures will ensure compliance with healthcare regulations for patient confidentiality and privacy. Another advantage of web-based security deployment is the potential to employ highly skilled resources that do not necessarily need to be based on-site.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrability:  \n",
    "Future integrations with IVF patient medical records will be possible and facilitated by a web-based deployment, given the right interface design. Allowing for exchange of patient data avilabl in the EMRs would open the possibility for enhanced learning, such as Natural Language Learning for interpreting physician notes and converting them to relevant features for IVF success rate prediction.\n",

    "I named this project \"Towards AI-Enabled In-Vitro Fertilization\" because this was a first step for myself towards understanding the IVF process and then the complexities involved in creating a comprehensive model that could predict success rates, and more importantly, make individualized recommendations for treatment in order to maximize the probability of success for each patient. This is the end-goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was my first semester in the Artificial Intelligence Master's program and I am beyond enthusiastic about all of the promising advancements that AI can bring to the medical industry, and other industries as well. Artificial Intelligence will contribute significantly to enhance the accuracy of predictive models for embryo selection, optimizing treatment protocols, and improving the overall success rates in IVF procedures. I believe this project has paved the way for me on this path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, the next steps involve continued refinement and validation of the chosen algorithm, and continue striving to build the most comprehensive and descriptive IVF dataset possible. I will continue to reach out to IVF clinics in hope that they would be interested in helping build this dataset. Ultimately, my goal is to continue advancing AI-Enabled IVF technology to bring hope to individuals seeking this assistive reproductive treatment."
