This assignment answers the following two questions. Please see notes / comments in the notebook.

**Section 1 (Unsupervised Cluster Analysis)**  
Using an unsupervised framework, analyze the clustering behavior of the data. Propose an unsupervised learning algorithm and analyze the different sub-populations for each cluster. Describe each of the sub-population for each of the clusters the model discovered. Is there a cluster where there is a high incidence of fraud? Lastly, provide a list of transactions that your data engineer can review to audit the veracity of their labels.

**Section 2 (Hyper-parameter tuning for Random Forest)**   
Analyze the behavior of a Random Forest model as you vary the values of its hyper parameters:

max_depth  
n_estimators  
max_features  

Graph the performance of each hyper-parameter as you vary their values. Use at least 4 different values for each hyper-parameter. Finally, summarize how you would design a Random Forest model using the results of your analysis.
